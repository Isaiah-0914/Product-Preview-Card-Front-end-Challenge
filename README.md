### Built with

### What I learned

This challenge helped me alot to understand responaive design better and to use media queries to make design responaive.
I also learned the importance of Sass preprocessor and how to use it.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on making designs responsive and also be confortable with Sass preprocessor.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/_a5j7KoflTs) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand Sass and how to use it. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
